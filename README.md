## Well Hello 👋

I'm a DevOps Consultant building solutions in the cloud. I enjoy solving folks challenges and showing them what is possible with automation. 

- 🌤️ I'm currently contributing to [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) providers and guiding others.
- 🌱 When time permits, I dabble in the frontend building simple apps to solve my own problems.
- 🔥 When I'm bored I can burn hours tweaking the home lab. Why? 🤷‍♂️
